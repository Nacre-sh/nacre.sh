title: Try Before the Beta Starts
---

For the last couples of weeks, we dedicated our energy in experimenting how to make an **intuitive shell**. This fruitful experimental phase (aka alpha) resulted in [Nacre](https://nacre.sh). We would be very happy if you could try it and give us your opinion!

```sh
npm install -g nacre
```

You can simply install Nacre with this given command (more installation instructions [here](../getting-started)) and follow [Getting started guide](../getting-started).

If you are familiar with Node REPL, it's very much the same but an extended form:
- you can navigate smoothly with preview, completion and your favorite builtins: `ls`, `cd`, `chmod`, `chown`, `stat`, `grep`, and [more](../docs#builtins).
- there is an auto-require mechanism imports your modules when you need it. Explicit import can also be done with `require()`.

**Feedback matters a lot to us**. We believe this is the only way to shape the most relevant roadmap for the next phase (beta). Tell us what you like, hate, expect, unexpect, wish to have, etc. on [Discord](https://discord.gg/AdVQfgqGBn) or by creating [issues on GitHub](https://github.com/nacresh/nacre/issues).

Many thanks!
