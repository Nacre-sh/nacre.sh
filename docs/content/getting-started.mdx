Welcome! Nacre is an open source **object-oriented shell** leveraging the full potential of **JavaScript** for those who prefer to work with objects rather than text.

This guide will help you to understand the fundamental principles of Nacre.

## Installation

Nacre relies on **NodeJS version 18**, so you must have it installed on your system. Follow their [installation instructions](https://nodejs.org/). Once this is done, install it using:

```shell
$ npm install --global nacre
```

## Interactive

To launch a nacre shell, simply run:

```shell
$ nacre
```

A prompt will invite you to run commands interactively.

### List directory

List the content of the working directory by running `ls()`:

```js
Welcome to Nacre version Beta. Find help at https://nacre.sh.
> ls()
[
  '.git',
  '.gitignore',
  '.idea',
  'LICENSE',
  'README.md',
  'docs',
  'gatsby-theme-doctornpm',
  'node_modules',
  'package-lock.json',
  'package.json'
]
```

You may notice that `ls()` command, unlike `ls` on more traditional shells, requires parentheses to display items in the current working directory. The reason is simple, Nacre is empowered by NodeJS, which means everything you write must follow the [JavaScript syntax](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript).

Without parentheses, `ls` returns a value of type function:

```js
> ls
[Function: ls] {
  help: 'List directory',
  recursive: [Function (anonymous)] { help: 'List directory recursively' }
}
```

This is particulary handy to understand to inspect the command and understand what you can do with it. In this case, it tells us that `ls` has a `recursive()` function.

```js
> ls.recursive()
[
  'components',
  'components/index-component.mdx',
  'components/index.mdx',
  'components/variant-select.mdx',
  'configuration',
  'configuration/header-links.mdx',
  'configuration/index.mdx',
  'configuration/navigation.mdx',
  'configuration/plugin.mdx',
  'getting-started.mdx',
  'index.mdx'
]
```

### Get file information

 Nacre provides a bunch of builtins such as `ls()`, `cd()`, `stat()`, `pwd()`, etc. with names similar to those of traditional shells, so you can quickly find your marks. You may know that `stat()` returns some information about a file, let's try it:

```js
> stat('index.mdx')
{
  name: 'index.mdx',
  type: 'file',
  size: 844,
  createdAt: 2022-02-10T10:20:52.844Z,
  modifiedAt: 2022-02-12T09:48:15.158Z,
  owner: 'arnauddebec',
  group: 'staff'
}
```

### Combine commands

If you are not familiar with `map()`, this is a JavaScript method which creates a new array populated with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array. Let's take an example:

```js
const myArray = [1, 2, 3, 4];

// for each element of the array, we multiply the element by 2
const result = myArray.map((element) => { return element * 2 });

// expected result: Array [1, 4, 6, 8]
console.log(result);
```

You know that `ls()` list the items of directory and that `stat()` displays information about an item. Let's combine them using `map()`:

```js
// for each element of the array, we apply the stat function on it
> ls.map((element) => { return stat(element) })

// or simply
> ls.map(stat)
[
  {
    name: 'components',
    type: 'directory',
    size: 160,
    createdAt: 2022-02-10T10:20:52.844Z,
    modifiedAt: 2022-02-10T10:20:52.844Z,
    owner: 'arnauddebec',
    group: 'staff'
  },
  {
    name: 'index-component.mdx',
    type: 'file',
    size: 383,
    createdAt: 2022-02-10T10:20:52.844Z,
    modifiedAt: 2022-02-10T10:20:52.844Z,
    owner: 'arnauddebec',
    group: 'staff'
  },
  {
    name: 'index.mdx',
    type: 'file',
    size: 154,
    createdAt: 2022-02-10T10:20:52.844Z,
    modifiedAt: 2022-02-10T10:20:52.844Z,
    owner: 'arnauddebec',
    group: 'staff'
  },
  ...
}
```

This a typical example on how you can leverage JavaScript's language and functions. Here is a last example, can you guess what it does?

```js
> ls.recursive().filter((e) => e.endsWith('.js')).map(stat).filter(s => s.size > 100).map(e => e.name)
```

Such long line becomes hard to read, you may prefer to write your code in a proper Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for nicer indentation and autocompletion. The next section will guide you on how to execute Nacre scripts.

## Scripting

You can save your script in file like you would do for a normal JavaScript file. In your preferred IDE, create `print-files.js`.

```js
#!/usr/bin/env nacre

'use strict';

/**
 * This is a file which demonstrates that nacre can also run a script file like NodeJS!
 */

// get the list of all items in the current directory and sub directories
const everyone = ls.recursive();

// filter all items to get only the files
const onlyFiles = everyone.filter(item => {
  const info = stat(item);
  return info.type === 'file';
});

// will print the list of files
console.log('list of all files:', onlyFiles);

// filter all files to get only those that ends with .js
const onlyJs = onlyFiles.filter((f) => f.endsWith('.js'));

// will print the list of js files
console.log('list of all JavaScript files:',onlyJs);
```

To run it (from bash):
```shell
$ nacre print-files.js
```

Or directly (from bash):
```shell
$ chmod +x ./print-file.js # adds permission to execute
$ ./print-file.js
```

## Module importation

### Auto-require

In the interactive mode, a module is automatically loaded when you type its name. Note that the module must be installed at a global level or in the current working directory.

Usage local auto-require:
```js
// install chalk module in the current working directory
npm.install('chalk')
chalk.blue('hello')
```

Usage global auto-require:
```js
// install lodash module at a global level
$('npm install --global lodash')
lodash.random();
```

### Require

Use `require` to explicitly import a command.

```js
> const myScript = require(path.resolve('./myScript.js'))
```

## Shortcuts

Those following shortcuts can save you some precious time. The exhaustive list of shortcuts can be found in the [documentation](docs#shortcuts).

| Shortcut | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `<ctrl> + C` | Quit Nacre / Remove the current line |
| `<ctrl> + A` | Move the cursor to the begining of the line |
| `<ctrl> + E` | Move the cursor to the end of the line |
| `<ctrl> + L` | Clear the screen of the terminal |
