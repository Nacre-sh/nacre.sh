title: Header links
---

The page header has several links on the right-hand side of the
black bar.  The navigation in this page header is also specified
by YAML configuration file, `src/gatsby-theme-doctornpm/header-nav.yml`.

This is an array of elements that contain only a title and url.

### Example

```yaml
- title: npmjs.com
  url: https://npmjs.com/
- title: npm CLI
  url: https://github.com/npm/cli
```
