title: Navigation configuration
---

The page navigation on the sidebar is controlled by a YAML configuration
file, `src/gatsby-theme-doctornpm/nav.yml`.

## Pages

Pages are defined with a `title` and a `url` property.  `title` is the
name to display in the navigation, and `url` is the destination of the link.

Pages may optionally include a `shortName` property, which will be used
instead of the `title` when space is at a premium (such as in a breadcrumb
trail).  They may also include a `description` property, which will be
shown on automatically generated index pages.

## Sections

A hierarchy is formed with sections.  Sections extend the definition in
a page (meaning they have a `title` and a `url`) but also have `children`,
which is an array of other pages or sections.

## Variants

Variants are similar pages or sections that should be represented as an
option for display.  For example, you may want to present multiple different
versions of documentation and let the user select a single version to
show in the navigation.

The navigation hierarchy will only display the pages and sections for
one individual variant at a time to reduce clutter and hierarchy depth.

If you're currently viewing a page within a variant, that variant's
hierarchy will be shown.  Otherwise, the default variant's hierarchy
will be shown.

Each variant may have the same pages, but does not need to.

In the example below, if you're viewing `/app/version-two/commands`
then the `version-two` variant will be shown.  Otherwise, the
`version-three` navigation will be shown, since it's the default.

## Example

```yaml
# This is a single page in the navigation
- title: Single page
  url: /single-page

# This is a section with three pages.
- title: Getting started
  url: /getting-started
  children:
  - title: Page one
    url: /getting-started/page-one
  - title: Page two
    url: /getting-started/page-two
  - title: Page three
    url: /getting-started/page-three

# This gives two variants for the app
# documentation, version two and version
# three.
- title: Application
  shortName: app
  url: /app
  variants:
  - title: Version 2.x
    url: /app/version-two
    children:
    - title: Installing
      url: /app/version-two/install
      description: Installing
    - title: Usage
      url: /app/version-two/usage
      description: Usage of v2
  - title: Version 3.x
    url: /app/version-three
    default: true
    children:
    - title: Installing
      url: /app/version-three/install
      description: Installing the app
    - title: Command line
      url: /app/version-three/usage
      description: Command-line usage
```
